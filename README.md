# kiro-2024

Kiro is a hackathon in Operations Research (OR), organized by _École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées_ in France. Students and young graduates from the top french engineering schools develop heuristics and algorithms to solve non-linear optimization problems. The team that gets the lowest overall cost on the sample datasets wins the challenge.

In 2024, the problem was proposed by Renault, one of the main French automotive manufacturers.
This code presents two solutions: A simple heuristic and a generative algorithm.
